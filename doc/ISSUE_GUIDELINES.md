**Columns on board:**
- **project-backlog ('Open' in Gitlab):** Contains issue ideas that come up from the client or the team. This is the place where the first idea of an issue starts and slowly more information gets added until the feature is ready to be put in the sprint-backlog. Issues that come up during the sprint should also be placed here, so the planned issues don't get postponed. You can also put issues here that are very big and are split up into many different smaller issues, to keep the information/documentation/discussion all in one place.
- **sprint-backlog:** Contains the issues planned for the current sprint. These issues should be finished before the sprint is finshed.
- **in-progress:** Contains issues that are being worked on at the moment
- **in-review:** Contains issues that are implemented and tested but await review from other team members
- **done ('Closed' in Gitlab):** Contains issues that are reviewed and merged

**Game plan for creating issues**:
- **Context:** Explain the conditions which led you to write this issue
- **Problem/Idea:** The context should lead to something, an idea or a problem you're facing
- **Solution/Next step:** You can involve others by asking for help or requesting feedback, assign somebody else to the issue, or you start to investigate further, but specifying what needs to be done next is an essential step in solving the issue otherwise it may become inactive. This last aspect is the most important part of an issue. When no clear steps are indicated it seriously prevents other members/developers the chance to engage in the discussion or propose possible solutions because other people have no clue what steps you have already undertaken and what is required at the moment to resolve the issue. 

In general it is also important to write down all the relevant information related to the issue that you can think of when you're creating the issue. It enables other members/developers to take over and provides invaluable context when you only have time to work on it days or weeks after creating it.

When the issue is ready to be moved to the sprint-backlog, items like:
- Assignee.
- Responsible person.
- estimation and explanation for this in terms of the client.
- priority and explanation for this in terms of the client.
can be added

Things to keep in mind when creating issues:
- Keep titles short and descriptive; Don't overload people with too much information right away
- Remain clear and concise; Keep your messages as short and to the point as possible. Bullet points are often a great way of quickly structuring complex ideas or solutions.
- Avoid jargon; Explain it in a way a non-expert user would also be able to understand it
- Don't create half-baked issues; Make sure the issue in itself can deliver something of value
- Try to make issues as independent from other issues as possible; Issues that are depending on other issues reduce the flexibility of the developers to work on something.
- Small and easily estimable in terms of time and resources required; The larger the issue is the harder is becomes to manage it. It also makes the task seem harder mentally than it would have been if the issue were to be split up.
- Measurable; You have concrete steps to check the result of the issue in the definition of done. Make something faster is vague and is impossible to know when it is achieved. Phrasing it differently like the process needs to finish in 1 second is measurable and is easier to work with.
- Negotiable; Meaning there are usually several ways to get to the stated goal. This is the right abstraction level of an issue. It leaves the developer enough room to find the best possible solution (with the help of their fellow developers in the discussion of the issue)
- Include the right people in your discussion; Who are the most relevant people to help resolve a particular issue?
- Add links to you references.
